# Demoing of custom Ansible modules

This is a series of demos on creating a custom Ansible module and then extracting a function from it out to a module_utils module.

It starts off small and each step builds on the last one.

* Steps 1..4 are all about local custom modules and local custom module_utils
* **TODO** Steps 5..? packaging up custom modules to be installed as an Ansible Collection
* **TODO** Steps 8..? packaging up custom module_utils to be installed via pip
